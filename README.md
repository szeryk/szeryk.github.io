# szeryk.github.io

My first landing page. Developed using HUGO and a theme: https://github.com/Yukuro/hugo-theme-shell.  
In `page_hugo_source` directory there is whole Hugo project. There are even generated files under `public` which are also copied to the main directory of the repo, so Github Pages can access index.html. This will be improve in future as I learn more about Gihub Pages - there is possibility (at least I've heard about it) to store just Hugo source files. Github pages can somehow generate web page from Hugo project (after each push) and host it.
